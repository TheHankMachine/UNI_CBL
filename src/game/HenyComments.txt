I really like the enemy AI. It's very simple yet effective. My one comment
on the enemies would be to give them screen wrap like we did the clouds.
That way, if I'm constantly flying up and to the right, the enemies
can catch up to me via the screen wrap, Otherwise, they are rarely ever on screen.

All planes could probably move a little slower.

Player angle input needs slight offset. Point the mouse directly down (and a smidge
to the right) and you'll see what I mean.
